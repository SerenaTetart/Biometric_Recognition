## General info
These are some little projects to learn how to identify people based on their biometrics using CNN, pre-trained models, triplet-loss etc...

## Requirements

The basic libraries for machine learning and computer vision ðŸ˜ƒ

Libraries:
* OpenCV (python)
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* Keras

## Project 1 - Fingerprint recognition

The dataset used is Sokoto Coventry Fingerprint Dataset (SOCOFing) from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ruizgara/socofing/home

The network is designed to have 2 inputs and substract embeddings from both inputs to classify if the inputs are from the same class or not.

The network is made from scratch and thus very slow to train, I achieved 87% accuracy (~13% error), if I want to improve it I will use Resnet50 or VGG19.

## Project 2 - Fingerprint autoencoder

This second project aim to **repair** damaged fingerprint by using an autoencoder also made from scratch.

We can also use this idea to improve handwritting for instance.
